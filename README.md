This project is here to show an error that is occuring for me when I combine `gatsby-plugin-mdx` with `gatsby-source-contentful`, as per the issue here: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/17875

If you create a new account with Contentful and use their sample "Lessons" application, you should see this error.

You just need to put the relevant keys into the `gatsby-config` and you should see the error.
